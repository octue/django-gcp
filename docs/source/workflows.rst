Workflows
=========

Workflows in django-gcp allow you to trigger and manage Google Cloud Workflows - orchestrations that
coordinate multiple services and APIs into stateful, long-running processes.

`django-gcp` provides a simple interface to invoke workflows deployed in GCP, track their execution
status, and monitor them via the GCP Console.
