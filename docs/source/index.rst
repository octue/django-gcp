    This library is used for a few apps in production, but it is still early in development.

==========
Django GCP
==========

``django-gcp`` is a library of tools to help you deploy and use django on Google Cloud Platform.
Helpers are provided for:

* `Cloud Storage <https://cloud.google.com/storage>`_,
* `Events (PubSub and EventArc) <https://cloud.google.com/pubsub>`_,
* `Structured Cloud Logging <https://cloud.google.com/logging>`_ and `Error Reporting <https://cloud.google.com/error-reporting>`_
* `Cloud Run (Metadata) <https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/container-contract#metadata-server>`_
* `Cloud Tasks <https://cloud.google.com/tasks>`_ and
* `Cloud Scheduler <https://cloud.google.com/scheduler>`_.

Aims
====

The ultimate goals are to:

- **Allow serverless django** (for actual fully-fledged apps, not toybox tutorials).

- **Enable event-based integration** between django and various GCP services.

- **Simplify the use of GCP resources in django** including Storage, Logging, Erorr Reporting, Run, PubSub, Tasks and Scheduler.

.. TIP::
    For example, if we have *both* a Store *and* a PubSub subscription to events on that store, we can do smart things in django when files or their metadata change.


Background
----------

To run a "reasonably comprehensive" django server on GCP, we have been using 4-5 libraries.
Each covers a little bit of functionality, and we put in a lot of time to:

.. code-block::

   engage maintainers -> fork -> patch -> PR -> wait -> wait more -> release (maybe) -> update dependencies

Lots of the maintainers of those libraries have given up or are snowed under, which we have a lot of compassion for.
Some, like django-storages, are (admirably) maintaining a uniform API across many compute providers,
whereas we don't change providers often enough to need that, so would rather have the flexibility to do
platform-specific things.

We'll be using GCP for the foreseeable future, so can accept a platform-specific API in order to use latest
GCP features and best practices.

This project is heavily based on a couple of really great libraries, particularly ``django-storages`` and ``django-cloud-tasks``.
See `our attributions page <https://github.com/octue/django-gcp/blob/main/ATTIBUTIONS.md>`_.

Thank you so much to the (many) authors of these libraries :)

Also, this library boilerplate is from the ``django-rabid-armadillo`` project...
